# matlab_image_resampling_without_builtin_functions
The following matlab code is used to resample an image without using built in functions for image processing. bilinear interpolation is used to determine the internsity of the pixels. Nearest neighbourhood approach is used for the corner pixels that are not possible to be interpolated due to positional limitation.
